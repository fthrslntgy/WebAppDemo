This is about a simple bound checker and its tests for homework of BIL481 lecture.
App.checkIsBetweenBounds method takes 4 parameters (int[] array, Integer index, int lowerBound, int upperBound) and checks if the number at "index"th index of array is between bounds. There may be some errors when array is empty or index is negative etc. AppTest checks these with some test cases.
